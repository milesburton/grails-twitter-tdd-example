# ✨ Mock Twitter Example: Standalone Grails Application for Learning 🌟

This repository contains a **standalone Grails application** designed as an educational tool. It uses a "Twitter" theme as an example to help students learn the basics of:

- 🏗️ Building a Grails application.
- 🧪 Writing unit and functional tests.
- 🤖 Simulating external services with mock data.
- 🌐 Creating fake endpoints for testing purposes.

This example is **not connected to Twitter** or any external libraries like Twitter4J. It is purely a demonstration project for learning purposes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Self-Contained Example**: No external dependencies or API keys are needed.
- **Mock Services and Endpoints**: Examples of stubbing and faking external interactions.
- **Testing Examples**: Includes pre-configured unit and functional tests using **Geb** and **Spock**.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to demonstrate Grails application structure and testing methodologies.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Grails Framework**: [Installation Guide](https://grails.org/download.html)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure compatibility with your Grails version.

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/mock-twitter-grails-example.git
   cd mock-twitter-grails-example
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   grails dependencies
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   grails run-app
   ```

   > **Note**: No external API keys are required. This project is entirely self-contained.

## 🧪 Running Tests

### ✅ Unit Tests

Run the unit tests to validate individual components:
```bash
grails test-app -unit
```

### 🌟 Functional Tests

Run the functional tests to verify end-to-end workflows:
```bash
grails test-app -functional
```

## 🛠️ Code Highlights

- 🤖 **Mock Services**: Demonstrates service stubbing for simulating external API calls (`src/test/groovy`).
- 🌐 **Fake Endpoints**: Provides example controllers for simulating API behavior (`grails-app/controllers`).
- 🌟 **Functional Tests with Geb**: Pre-configured functional tests located in `src/integration-test/groovy`.

## 📚 Notes for Students

- This project is intended for **learning purposes only**.
- The "Twitter" theme is used purely as a conceptual example.
- Feel free to adapt the project to explore other themes or use cases.
