# Mock Twitter Example: Standalone Grails Application for Learning

This repository provides a **standalone Grails application** that uses a "Twitter" concept as an educational example. It is designed to help students learn how to:

- Build a basic Grails application.
- Test application functionality using unit and functional tests.
- Mock services and endpoints to simulate real-world use cases.

This example does not integrate with Twitter or any third-party libraries like Twitter4J. It is purely a demonstration tool.

## About

The "Twitter" theme is used as an example to structure the application's content and features. The project focuses on foundational Grails development practices and testing methodologies.

Key components include:

- **Unit Tests**: Isolated tests for application logic.
- **Functional Tests**: Simulated end-to-end tests using **Geb**.
- **Mock Services**: Examples of stubbing services to mimic external interactions.
- **Fake Endpoints**: Demonstrations of how to create simulated API responses.

## Features

- **Standalone Example**: Fully self-contained Grails application for demonstration purposes.
- **Mock Services and Endpoints**: Replace real-world integrations with simulated data.
- **Testing Examples**: Pre-configured unit and functional tests for learning purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Grails**: Ensure you have Grails installed. [Installation Guide](https://grails.org/download.html)
